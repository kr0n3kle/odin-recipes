    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The classic low and slow smoked beef brisket that everyone loves! Done correctly, this requires <em>no</em> sauce!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 8-22lb full size packer brisket (prime grade or higher preferred)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Start fire in pit and stablize temperature between 225F to 240F degrees, water pan filled if equipped</li>
        <li>Trim brisket fat cap to approximately 1/4" thickness. Remove excess fat around point side also.</li>
        <li>Coat brisket liberally with mixture of salt, pepper and garlic. Do not underuse seasoning!</li>
        <li>Important: Place brisket into smoker with fat cap facing <em>towards the direction</em> of the heat source. </li>
        <li>Spray very lightly with water or other liquid of your choice once every hour or two up to 5 hours.</li>
        <li>After about 5 hours, remove the brisket and wrap tightly in butcher paper, noting the direction the fat cap faces.</li>
        <li>Place brisket back into smoker like before. Continue to cook until the brisket is jiggly which occurs around 200F IT.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Some important notes</h3>
    <p>Do not continue to check on the brisket while it cooks. If you lookin' you ain't cookin'! Do not overspray the brisket, you will lose seasoning!</p>
